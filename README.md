# GameDevelopment
Create a game development within one year.
Absolutely, Adarsh! Here’s a perfect summary, complete workflow, and use case design tailored to your GPS-based number plate recall game app. This structure is clean enough for planning and presentation, and practical for development.

🎯 Game Summary

A real-world memory-based mobile game where players walk from a source to a destination (~1 km). Along the way, virtual cars appear at GPS-based checkpoints, each with a number plate announced via voice. At the end of the walk, players must recall and enter the number plates they encountered.

⸻

🧩 Game Use Case

✅ Primary Use Case: “Play Memory Route”

Actor	Player (User with Smartphone + GPS)
Precondition	GPS enabled, app permissions granted
Trigger	Player selects source & destination

Main Flow
	1.	Player opens the app and starts a new game.
	2.	Player selects a route (auto-generated or manually set).
	3.	App displays real-time map with player’s position.
	4.	As player walks, the app detects when near a checkpoint.
	5.	A virtual car “appears” (UI + TTS): A number plate is displayed and read out loud.
	6.	The number disappears after a few seconds.
	7.	Steps 4–6 repeat until player reaches the destination.
	8.	At destination, app shows input screen: “Enter all number plates you saw.”
	9.	Player inputs memory-based answers.
	10.	App compares inputs to actual values and shows a score.

🛠️ Technical Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. User Interface Flow

Splash Screen → Home Screen → Route Selector → Game Play (Live Map + Car Events) → Recall Screen → Score Screen


⸻

2. Core Modules

Module	Description
Location Tracker	Tracks user GPS in real-time
Map Engine	Shows walking route with player marker
Checkpoint System	Defines GPS points along the path to trigger car appearances
Number Plate Generator	Randomly creates unique, realistic car numbers
Text-to-Speech (TTS)	Announces car numbers audibly
Memory Log	Stores car numbers for later comparison
Recall UI	Input form at destination to recall numbers
Scoring Engine	Compares entered vs actual numbers


⸻

🔁 Complete Game Workflow

➤ 1. Route Setup
	•	Player selects start & end point (either fixed or map-based)
	•	System calculates the route and defines car checkpoints (every 200–300 meters)

➤ 2. Walk Begins
	•	Map and GPS activate
	•	Player sees walking path and distance remaining
	•	As user approaches checkpoints:
	•	A random number plate appears and disappears after 3–5 seconds
	•	The number is spoken aloud

➤ 3. Reach Destination
	•	Player gets recall screen with number input boxes
	•	Enters number plates in order (or freeform list)

➤ 4. Score & Feedback
	•	System evaluates:
	•	Correct entries (order can be optional)
	•	Score = Correct entries / Total checkpoints
	•	Shows feedback, time taken, and next route option

⸻

📘 Example Use Case (Scenario)

User: Adarsh wants to try the game during a morning walk.
	•	He opens the app → selects his home to park (~1.2 km).
	•	App maps route and places 4 virtual checkpoints.
	•	As he walks:
	•	First checkpoint: “KL07 AJ 1234” appears with sound
	•	Next: “TN05 ZY 0091”
	•	…
	•	At the park, recall screen pops up.
	•	He inputs “KL07 AJ 1234”, “TN05 ZY 0091”, etc.
	•	App scores 3/4 correct, gives feedback and score history.

⸻

🧠 Optional Advanced Ideas (Phase 2+)
	•	Fake number plates to confuse player
	•	Timer for recall round
	•	Multiplayer mode (compare scores)
	•	Leaderboards (Firebase)
	•	Rewards for streaks/milestones

⸻

🔐 Permissions Needed (App Setup)
	•	Location Access (Foreground)
	•	Internet Access
	•	Notification Access (Optional for reminders)
